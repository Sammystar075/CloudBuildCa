# Tell Cloud Build where to send logs
# CLOUD_LOGGING_ONLY avoids storage bucket permission issues
options:
  logging: CLOUD_LOGGING_ONLY

steps:
  # STEP 1: Build the Docker image
  # --------------------------------
  # This uses the Dockerfile in THIS repo
  # "." means: use the current repo as the build context
  - name: gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker
    args:
      [
        "build",
        "-t", "gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/markdown-editor:latest",
        "."
      ]

  # STEP 2: Push the image to Container Registry
  # --------------------------------------------
  # This uploads the image so Cloud Run can use it
  - name: gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker
    args:
      [
        "push",
        "gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/markdown-editor:latest"
      ]

  # STEP 3: Deploy to Cloud Run
  # ---------------------------
  # This replaces the running service with the new image
  - name: gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud
    args:
      [
        "run", "deploy", "markdown-editor",
        "--image", "gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/markdown-editor:latest",
        "--platform", "managed",
        "--region", "us-central1",
        "--allow-unauthenticated",
        "--port", "8080"
      ]

# This is optional but nice:
# it lets Cloud Build know which image was produced
images:
  - "gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/markdown-editor:latest"
